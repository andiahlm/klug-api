It's time for an emotional interview.\r<00:17>Emotional interview.\r<00:21>So here's how it works. Okay? We're gonna have a normal conversation with each other, except ever so often we're gonna hear this 'ding' sound. That was great timing there. And when we hear that, we'll be given an emotion or situation that we have to act out as we keep talking.\r<00:36>Okay.\r<00:36>Sound good? \r<00:37>Okay.\r<00:39>Here we go. Alright, ready?
